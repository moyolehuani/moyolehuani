# Hi. ✨

I figured I should start building my portfolio... but I'm unsure where to start. 🌸

🌸💌🧺🍓🖍️📚🎀🐈🧠🎨

---

## a bit about me: 🐾💌

I am uncomfortable at the thought of being perceived; I'm also extremely shy — but I think I do a very good job of masking both. Sort of. 🎀

I like books, math, dragons, Liverpool Football Club, theatre, makeup, history, cats, stationery, colorful things, and documentaries.  
📚➗🐉⚽🎭🎨🖌️🐈

🌸💌🧺🍓🖍️📚🎀🐈🧠🎨

## what i do: 🧸🍰

I spend quite some time (possibly maladaptively) daydreaming about being a Ñoldorín elf liquidator in a Middle-Earth Chernobyl. 🧝‍♀️🌋  
A lot of the time, I can also be found thinking about Mathematics. ➗🧠

I'm interested in:
- Fourier Analysis
- Probability Theory
- Lévy Flights
- Semigroups
- Signal Analysis
- Wavelets
- Stochastic Simulation
- Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
- Applications to Anthropology, Mythology, Folk Studies, and other Social Sciences/Humanities 🕯️🌍

I simply love knowledge and have too much curiosity about how the world works. 🌸

While my aspirations lie mainly within "academics," I also have professional experience in **Data Analysis/Science**, having worked as an Analyst/Specialist in Marketing & Brand Business Intelligence — which I also love. 📊🎀

🌸💌🧺🍓🖍️📚🎀🐈🧠🎨

## what to expect: 🍓

So, welcome to my dump/portfolio. 🧺✨  
I am terrible at sharing the stuff I create with the rest of the world — again because I am shy, anxious, and too demanding of myself. But I will try. 🐣

(At least some of it... some things I can't share because I signed an NDA. Haha.) 🔒😅
